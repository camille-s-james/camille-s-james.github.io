        <h2>Graphic Novel Text-to-Speech</h2>
        <p>This project was made for one of my best friends!! The program allows users to screenshot any graphic novel and reads the comic out loud to them. 
            This was to help people with visual disabilities, as there are no programs that exsit that read comics out loud.
            This project was 8 months of learning time managment, presentation, logic and Python haha. I recieved funding for this project through Southwestern's
            King Creativity Fund. These pictures are of me presenting it at the King Creativity Symposium! Overall, I'm very happy I got to create something
            for my friend! A website is coming soon :) </p>
