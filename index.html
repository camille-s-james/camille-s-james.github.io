        <div class = "text">I’m Camille, a rising senior majoring in Computer Science at Southwestern University. You’re reading this because I decided it was finally time to get around and learn how to make a website! I’m currently a Product Management Intern at Mastercard, with interests in product, software engineering, Human-Computer Interaction and Machine Learning! Outside of computer science I try to stay pretty creative- I play clarinet, love to read and garden, and I’m currently learning how to knit! I’m always looking to pick up a new hobby, and I think being offline makes me a better computer scientist. :)
